# Data Engineering Challenge

Werkspot is a marketplace that connects homeowners with professionals to arrange home services.

The typical journey of a homeowner and a professional is as follows:

- A homeowner posts a job
- Interested professionals get in touch with the homeowner by writing a "Proposal";
- Contact details are shared between homeowner and professional if both parties are interested.

This assignment will focus on the activity of the **professionals**.

For the purpose of this assignment, let's assume that in order to become an active member on the platform, the professional needs to create an account, choose the services they specialise in (e.g. gardening, painting, etc), and agree with the terms and conditions.

Once these steps are met, the professional can start getting in touch (="Proposing") with homeowners.
